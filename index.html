    <p id ="txt1">Goals for dec 15th --> 1 finish html 1. --> 2 use a for loop once in codewars --> Reflection --> I accomplished these goals, with a little help from my friends and by friends I mean classmates. --> I had to redo my entire html 1 on the 15th which took up the majority of my time, I had hoped to finish early and dive into the second one. --> Saying this I really need to pick up the pace at which I work. JS still scares the crap outta me, I can understand some basic concepts but It seems like I lack practical usage. --> I’ve tried using codewars to practice my skills but It seems like I cannot pass even the lowest of tests. Maybe it's like a magic eye poster and It'll come into view soon, hopefully. Ill work more on it tomorrow </p>
    <p id ="txt2">Goals for the 10th of Jan 2018 --> 1 Turn in Gmoney 1 --> 2 Fix my Canvas project --> 3 Turn in Gmoney 2 --> Reflection --> Today’s goals while few were challenging. I only completed 3 of the 4 I set for myself as I took one look at Gmoney 2 and said I’ll do it tomorrow. Doing GMoney 1 took longer than expected, I ended up spending most of my working hours doing it but I managed to finish it and get it passed by using a nested for loop. I spent some time bug fixing a personal canvas project that introduced me to some basic elements of object oriented programming. As it turns out I had the ordering of some of my curly brackets off, which is something I will have to watch out for in the future. As I stated earlier I didnt get round to Gmoney 2 today I probably bit off a bit more than I could chew for one day. If I could do anything differently I would have committed more time into Gmoney 2 to make sure I completed it.</p>
    <p id ="txt3">Goals for the 11th of Jan 2018 --> Turn in Gmoney 2 --> Add interactivity to my canvas project --> Reflection --> Today I only had a couple of goals but I had to put in some extra time post class to accomplish them. Gmoney 2 ate up most of my prime working hours as the answer wasn’t obvious from the onset I evetully used an if statment inside a for loop to push new info into an object. Adding interactivity to my canvas project was good practice for DOM manipulation, It cemented my cursory knowledge on the topic. Tomorrow I would like to start on Gmoney 3 but I heard we’re gonna be doing a project that day so I doubt I will get the chance todo it.</p>
    <p id ="txt4">Meet-up write-up #1 The 12th of Dec 2017 Code for Denver. --> People met --> 1. David Viramontes, Software Engineer at Gloo --> 2. Robert Sedivy, Engineering Lead at Black & Veatch --> What I learned in boating school is… --> Going to code for Denver was a unique experience, All of a sudden I found myself surrounded by a group of folks each of them veterans of projects untold. My previous experience stood pale in comparison. I could barely keep pace with the diction of the assignments let alone the execution of said assignments. However I came out with a level of knowledge that surpassed what I intially went in with.The number one take away from the meet up was an introduction to Auth0. While my understanding of the inner workings of Auth0 remain rudimentary a bare bones introduction was useful to, at the very least, dig the hole where the future foundation would go. -->Questions 1. How to properly use Auth0? 2. Are there other, different authorization programs? 3. What is the best way to organize a large team through github?</p>
    <p id ="txt5">Meetup write up #2 November 29 2017 Learn to code --> People met --> 1 Leeria Makira Works as a freelance back end developer, --> 2 Rachel Mcbrownhair (I didn't get her last name sry) Fresh out of college business major trying to make a start-up. --> Things learned --> The learn to code events have been consistently my favorite learning events. At this one I spent most of the time studying semantic Html and getting to know my classmates better. Making a html document semantic takes patience and an eye for foresight. Which I dont have so telling myself to not make a million and one div’s with a million classes took time. --> Questions asked. --> 1 How regular are the regulars? 2 What's the “ideal” way a html page should be laid out? 3 How do I make keyboard inputs for a browser?</p>

    <p id ="txt7">Learn to learn #1 The 13th of December 2017 Flexbox --> Setting the stage --> 1.Started mid day drank coffee beforehand. --> 2.Cleared my desktop of all other information and only had flex froggy open. --> 3.Silenced my phone and disconnected it from the internet. --> 4.Used one of the curtain rooms to isolate myself. --> Reflection --> Even tho it took a few hours I managed to grasp flexbox through flex froggy. After finishing the tests I looked over my notes from earlier and realized that I was overthinking what flexbox and CSS is. Since then I’ve revisited flex froggy and after a few days I’ve cemented my understanding. Any holes I might’ve had were eliminated. Flexbox works for the moment, I would like to explore grid if I can find the time but for the moment flexbox will have to be what I rely on for relative positioning. </p>
    <p id ="txt8">Learn to learn #2 Dec 18th 2017	Functions? --> What I am learning --> While doing my preliminary research into javascript I was confounded on what functions were. I have had some previous experience in coding and plenty of concepts such as if statements and data flow carried over, so I asked myself what are functions? --> Setting the stage --> 1 cleared my schedule of drills. --> 2 Attended all Javascript related breakouts hosted by g70. --> 3 asked plenty of questions, especially the dumb ones. --> 4 took plenty of illegible notes --> “Play” Messing around and building basic functions with the guidance of some g70 peers is what I spent most of that day doing. Learning that functions recall/ create variables and make them do things I created a basic addition calculator with the knowledge that I learned</p>
    <p id ="txt9">Learn to learn #3 Jan 3 2017 Diving into sockets --> What I am learning. --> Over the last couple of weeks I've been interested in learning about sockets. So I dedicated my winter break to learning about them. --> Setting the stage --> 1 Created a playlist for socket related videos. --> 2 Hooked up a second monitor so I could have a better workspace. --> 3 Blocked reddit so I wouldn’t get distracted. --> 4 Installed nodemon to help with development as well as all other libraries --> “Play” -->Once I felt comfortable enough with the knowledge of sockets I could scrounge from the internet I decided to try to implement it in a chat app. With enough time, and caffeine, I managed to create a super basic app that communicates text between as many people as my server could accommodate… hopefully, maybe.</p>
